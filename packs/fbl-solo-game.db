Roll $capital[Scouting] to see if the encounter can be spotted in time. If you roll two or more [x] you gain +1 on the next roll relating to the Encounter. If needed, resolve the encounter.</li><li>Use oracles (below Oracles) as needed to resolve situations that would normally need a GM.</li><li>Proceed to next Quarter Day and start again from step #1.</li></ol><h3>New Hex Procedure</h3><p>Whenever you enter a new hex, draw from @FBL[Draw.RBiZU70kqvI1fWue]{Encounter Types}. You may also want to consult the @FBL[Roll.1XABtIvXwK9kR4gj]{Locations} tables or the Wilderness Oracle.</p><p>If you want to use published adventure sites, you will need to read them first to understand how they work. While many solo players do indeed play published adventures in this way, it can only be done by separating player and character knowledge, and you must be content with revealing an adventure site’s secrets prior to runningit.</p><p>To include published adventure sites, you must decide on how often and which published adventure sites to use whenever an Ace is drawn.</p><h3>Exploring The Map</h3><p>Hexcrawling is central to the Forbidden Lands experience, and thankfully it is quite well-suited to solo play. The @UUID[JournalEntry.bSeiSsYCctzi59dE.JournalEntryPage.6Bnl1c4tPLUYY2eL]{Journey Rules} from the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> are suitable more or less as-is. The only area which needs addressing is when $capital[Keeping Watch] at camp, since the GM would normally decide whether something happens. To address this, simply draw from @FBL[Draw.dYpVcGPvp8Z80CNE]{General Encounters} to see if anything happens while you are resting in your camp.</p><p>The many available published adventure sites are written for a GM. If you use them in a solo game, you will need to disconnect what you read from what your PC knows. Start with reading the flavor text for the site and then progress slowly through the rest of the text, asking the oracle questions regularly along the way.</p><h3>General Encounters</h3><p>@FBL[Draw.dYpVcGPvp8Z80CNE]{General Encounters}</p><p>These entries are deliberately vague. Use one or more oracles (below Oracles) to obtain more detail, such as location details, the demeanor of $capital[Npc]s, etc. If you draw an $capital[Npc] or group of $capital[Npc]s, a good general rule of thumb is to have the same number as the number of PCs (including Companions), but you can also use this [[D3]] or [[D6]] if you want to make it more random. Note that this table is designed for use in Ravenland - if playing in the Bitter Reach, The Bloodmarch, or elsewhere, you’ll need to adapt the results accordingly.</p><h3>Oracles</h3><p>In solo roleplaying games, an oracle is a simple mechanic which can be used to randomly generate answers to questions or provide further information on a topic. Playing cards are used for the oracles here.</p><p>In addition to providing 13 different card values and 4 suits, the color of the card can also be used to give a binary answer in many situations - Red being a positive answer, Black being negative.</p><h4>Yes/No Oracle</h4><p>Rule number 1 is to go with your gut!</p><ul><li>If you’re not sure of the odds or they’re 50/50, only draw one card.</li><li>If the odds are Likely, draw two cards and take the most positive result (high red &gt; low black).</li><li>If the odds are Unlikely, draw two cards and take the most negative result (high black &gt; low red).</li></ul><h4>Helpful/Hazardous Oracle</h4><p>In many situations, you may wish to know how hazardous or hostile an encounter is. This can also be used for NPCs and villages. In that case, roll for your Reputation first and use the oracle if you are not known, to find out how people react to you.</p><h4>Theme Oracle</h4><p>At times you may wonder at a situation you find yourself in - perhaps a general encounter doesn’t make much sense at first, you need some more information from an NPC, or you need help with some other idea. Whenever you are stuck in such a way, consult the oracle. If the meaning is not clear, draw a second card and treat one as a minor theme.</p><h4>Wilderness Oracle</h4><p>The locations from the oracle are intended to give a bit of flavor to the hex you are traveling in. Perhaps you are wondering where you have made camp for the night, or where exactly an encounter with some refugees takes place.</p><h4>Kin Oracle</h4><p>It can be used to determine the kin of an encounter.</p><h4>Kin Names Oracle</h4><p>Ailanders and Half-Elf Elvenspring take Elven names. Half-Elf Frailers take Alderlander names.</p><h4>Traits Oracle</h4><p>Use this oracle to help determine an NPC’s outlook and motivations. It can also be used to determine the outlook for a community.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"dncN5PmV6zfPk4XA":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"forbidden-lands","systemVersion":"11.4.2","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1709161200000,"modifiedTime":1709161200000,"lastModifiedBy":"wPtkZfWaSyfvbTMH"}}],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"66F2aueUup9DeaJq":3,"dncN5PmV6zfPk4XA":3},"flags":{"forbidden-lands":{"isBook":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"forbidden-lands","systemVersion":"11.4.2","coreVersion":"11.315","createdTime":1709161200000,"modifiedTime":1709161200000,"lastModifiedBy":"wPtkZfWaSyfvbTMH"}}],"scenes":[],"tables":[{"folder":"IYsdoFgXH0czepKP","name":"General Encounters - Solo Game","_id":"6yXXJoifP6qBcELp","img":"icons/svg/d20-grey.svg","description":"","results":[{"type":0,"weight":1,"range":[1,1],"drawn":false,"_id":"dqbLSJM5hFFGCpQN","text":"@UUID[Actor.Yni3M7jRuLlC1VKU]{Sorcerer} &amp; @UUID[Actor.nvJGFkvtJ43k79Pz]{Soldier}","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","documentId":null},{"type":0,"weight":6,"range":[2,7],"drawn":false,"_id":"xnAjX6CqwKia5pNb","text":"@UUID[JournalEntry.eTAlilxolEChbnHT.JournalEntryPage.HeyitCLvQ7Q48bds]{No encounter}","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","documentId":null},{"type":0,"weight":1,"range":[8,8],"drawn":false,"_id":"X1vzgV3vrjY5xcE3","text":"Unusual smell emanating from the ground.","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","documentId":null},{"type":0,"weight":1,"range":[9,9],"drawn":false,"_id":"ohM7j64uADhUc7gi","text":"Faint smell of smoke on the breeze.","flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/d20-black.svg","documentId":null},{"type":0,"weight":1,"range":[10,10],"drawn":false,"_id":"SJ2LrPYDgqSR7eUl","text":"Some game wanders into view!
